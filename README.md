# Micro Frontend â€“ Using different platforms

This is the proof of concept app for using different frontend frameworks in a micro-frontend host application.

## Micro apps

* Home - host app built using vanilla JS
* Nav - built using React
* Counter - built using Svelte
* Store - build using vanilla JS (no UI)

The MFE code is shared using module federation (webpack 5). Single spa is used to manage the shared resources (UI MFE)

## how does it works

* The micro UI apps is sharing code via module federation and using single spa library for exporting app life cycle methods. Here is example for React using single spa lifecycle methods: https://single-spa.js.org/docs/ecosystem-react
* The store app is only using module federation for sharing code as it is non UI code.
* The apps components are mounted in host apps using html id's like single-spa-application:header
* The remote entry (from modfed) is loaded in host using script tags
* Single spa library will manage the micro app using above html id's and the life cycle methods exported from micro apps.
* More information on single spa: https://single-spa.js.org/docs/getting-started-overview

# Getting Started
This project uses yarn as package manager and yarn workspaces to manage packages

```sh
yarn install
yarn start
```

Above commands will install dependencies in all micro apps and serve all apps in their respective ports.

Host App: Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).
